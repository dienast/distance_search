distance_search
===============

A plugin for [Osclass](http://osclass.org), a free and open source classifieds script.
This plugin makes it possible to get search results based on the distance between cities.

## Requirements
Version 3.0 or greater
Google Maps plugin

## Quick Start
* Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/dienast/distance_search/archive/master.zip)
* Clone the git repo â€” git clone https://github.com/sydcode/custom_attributes.git
* Make sure you have installed the Google Maps plugin with a working v3 (see: http://forums.osclass.org/development/google-maps-api-deprecated/) 
* Once you have installed the plugin you yourself should import the latitude and longitude values of all your cities in the columns 'd_coord_lat' and 'd_coord_long' of your osclass city table. You can use a batch converter (e.g. http://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/batch-geocode/) to generate the lat and long values.
